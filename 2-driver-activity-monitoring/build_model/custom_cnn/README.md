
The custom CNN based is build using Convolution Network, max-pooling, and fully connected layer. Objective behind having custom CNN model to find model with volume less than 1million parameter and F1 score above 0.95. This model is build using 5 convolutions layer with each layer is followed by max-pooling of size 2X2 and dropout layer with rate of 0.25. In each convolution layer padding is set as “same”. For first two layers kernel size is 3X3 and for layer 3,4 and 5, the kernel size is used as 5X5. As per preprocessing step all images are resized to 128 X 128 and normalized. After experimenting with various hyperparameters, the final model is build using RMSprop optimizer with a learning rate of 1e-3, batch size of 64, epochs of 50 and categorical cross-entropy is used as the loss function with metrics as accuracy. The total number of parameters of the model found to be 649,162 which is very less as compared to volume reported by ResNet50 and VGG16 model. Below figure show model architecture for custom model using CNN and dense network.
