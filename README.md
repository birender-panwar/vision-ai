**My Projects and experimental works in field of computer vision using deep learning**

## MONOCULAR DEPTH ESTIMATION AND SEGMENTATION SIMULTANEOUSLY
**In this project custom dataset of around half million images are created and various CNN Network are build that can do monocular depth estimation and foreground-background separation simultaneously.**

## DRIVER ACTIVITY MONITORING
**AI based Driver Activity Monitoring Solution to avoid car accidents due to driver distractions. The objective is to build a prediction model that monitors driver activities under varieties of driving conditions and external environment including driving during day time and night time. A predictive system that can recognize any distraction while driving like expression arising due to attending phone calls, testing, drinking, talking to the passenger, or deviating from the standard driving alignment, and this is going to be a multi-class predictive system. This system is useful in the prediction of such anomalies and retrospection of an unlikely and any unfortunate event of accidents

This work is implementing the ResNet50, VGG16, and custom CNN classification network on State Farm Distracted Detection Kaggle case study competition dataset. The model is finally deployed on on Raspberry PI4(RPI4) hardware.

# OBJECT DETECTION USING YOLO-V3
500 unique dataset is collected for class "Donald Duck" whcih is not avaiable in YoloV3. Dataset is self annotated using VGG Annotation tools and trained using Yolo-v3 network.
